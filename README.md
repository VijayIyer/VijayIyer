- ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github Profile!! I am Vijay Iyer. I am a Software Developer, interested in building web applications. 
- I am skilled in many technologies like React.js, Express.js, and Flask (Python) and in programming languages like Javascript (Typescript, ES6 syntax), Python and C#.NET.
- I aim to write clean, readable and performant code which follows best practices as well as use my knowledge of Databases (SQL Server, MySQL, MongoDB) and Cloud technologies in integrating web applications.
- I have created many personal projects, most of them are ongoing and I make changes to code when I can. I usually start my personal projects from scratch, with minimal code to begin with, then start adding more features, refactoring. This has helped me learn to improve my code structure and organization.
